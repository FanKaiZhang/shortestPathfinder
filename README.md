# shortestPathfinder
Shortest Pathfinder using the A* Path Finding Algorithm and a GUI to visualize the algorithm using Pygame.

This pathfinding project taught me how to implement the A* algorithm using python. I also built a path finding visualizer tool to visualize the pathfinding algorithm as it runs, using pygame. The A* pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which means it is much more efficient that your standard algorithms like breadth first search or depth first search. the A* algorithm is just like Dijkstra's algorithm, and the only difference is that A* tries to look for a better path by using a heuristic function, which gives priority to nodes that are supposed to be better than others while Dijkstra's just explore all possible ways.
